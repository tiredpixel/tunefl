## Contributions

Contributions are embraced with much love and affection!
Please fork the repository and wizard your magic, ensuring that any tests are not broken by the changes. :)
Then send me a pull request.
If you'd like to discuss what you're doing or planning to do, or if you get
stuck on something, then just wave. :)

Do whatever makes you happy. We'll probably still like you. :)

Tests are written using [RSpec](http://rspec.info/). To run all tests:

    foreman run rspec

There are not many tests, because the application is very simple. If generating a score from the home page works, then things are probably okay.


## Blessing

May you find peace, and help others to do likewise.
