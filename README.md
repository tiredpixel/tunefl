## Development

To run all tests:

```bash
foreman run rspec
```

Tests are written using [RSpec](http://rspec.info/).
There are not many tests, because the application is very simple.
If generating a score from the home page works, then things are probably okay.


## Stay Tuned

You can become a
[watcher](https://github.com/tiredpixel/tunefl/watchers)
on GitHub. And you can become a
[stargazer](https://github.com/tiredpixel/tunefl/stargazers)
if you are so minded. :D


## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and prepare your patches
in one or more branches, ensuring that any tests are not broken by the changes.
Then, send me one or more pull requests. Proposed patches will then be reviewed
prior to acceptance, usually into `master` branch.
If you'd like to discuss something, then please get in touch.

Do whatever makes you happy. We'll probably still like you. :)


## Blessing

May you find peace, and help others to do likewise.
